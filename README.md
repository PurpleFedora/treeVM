# treeVM - Tree based bytecode VM




## Program & Data
### dpc-address
The dpc-address is used to get labels and literals in the program/data areas.
It is defined as a union type,
```c
typedef union vm_dpc_address {
    uint32_t ld;        //Use for addressing with a loader
    uint16_t it[2];     //Use for addressing with a interpreter
} vm_dpc_address_t
```

### Loaders
The program and data area are both organized as an up to (2³² - 1) elements big block of memory
the VM expects that it doesnt change during runtime

### Interpreters
The program and data area are both organized as an up to (2¹⁶ - 1) chunks, each with a size of up to (2¹⁶ - 1) elements
the vm expects that the individual chunks dont change, when reallocating the array of chunks the interpreter should lock the areas,
the vm uses the vmx_interpreter_lock and vmx_interpreter_lock unlock functions for synchronization.



### Data
#### Alignment & Addressing
Data types are aligned to 8-Bytes and addressed as 8-Byte elements

#### Small Numbers
32-Bit numbers are stored in the instruction itself, see int32, uint32 and float Data types

#### Big Numbers
Doubles are stored in the data area as a single 8-Byte element

#### Strings
Strings are stored in the data area starting at an 8-Byte element,
the first element contains the string header (`vm_string_t`),
the size field of the string header is ignored, so it is recommended that both fields are set to the length

## Nodes and Children
The program always starts in the root node, and can enter into child nodes, or leave child nodes,
only the children of the current nodes can be addressed by instructions.

### Enter
The enter instruction "enters" a child of the current node, and makes it the new current node

### Leave
The leave instruction leaves a node, and goes back to the parent node

### Apush and Apop
The Apush removes a node and appends it to an subtree, Apop removes the last node in the subtree and returns it




## Functions and Calls
### Arguments
The VM only allows the child nodes to be used as arguments

### Returns
The function can return a single node, that will take the place of the parent node




## Heap and Objects
### References
Heap objects can be opened by a reference, when a reference is copied it is alway registerd,
when deleting a reference, it is also registered,
when there are no more references left the object is freed


### Open Objects
When an object is opened it becomes part of the main tree, and gets synced back when closing,
therefore there can only be one open reference per object.
Open objects cant be moved in the tree,
if there is an open node in a cleared subtree, the node will be cleared and closed




### Heap Instructions
#### new
New creates an new object in the heap and puts reference into the specified node

#### free
Free frees an object in the heap, and invalidates the reference

#### open
Open a heap reference, so that it can be accessed by the node
It also stores the value of the node in the heap, so that it can be gotten back when closing

#### close
Closes a heap object, it sets the value of the node to the node stores in the heap




## Integration
How to integrate the vm into a loader/interpreter

### Include
The include.h file must be included


### Compilation
1. Compile the treevm.c file as an object file, `gcc treevm.c -c -options`
2. Compile the loader/interpreter as an object file `gcc loader.c -c -options`
3. Link the files together with `gcc -o output loader.o treevm.o`

output is a placeholder for the resulting binary file, loader.c/loader.o is a placeholder for the loader/interpreter


### Compiler Options
Clang and GCC provide the -D option which can be used to define a macro, during compilation,
The following macros can be set for the VM
| Name                 | Prupose   
| -------------------- | ------
| -DLOADER             | If defined use a loader
| -DINTERPRETER        | If defined use a interpreter
| -DFORCE_SWITCH       | Force the use of a switch, even if a jump table is available
| -DEXPLICIT_LHCAT     | Say that LHCAT is defined though a global variable, instead of the default of 8


### Globals
The following globals and functions must be defined so that the VM can be used


| Declaration                                               | Purpose

The following globals are exposed to the loader/interpreter
| Declaration                                                          | Purpose
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------
| const double VM_MAX_PRECISE_DOUBLE                                   | Biggest precise integer a double can represent
| int vm_get_build_information(volatile int no_print)                  | Print vm information, if no_print isnt set
| vm_error_t vm_run_main(const vm_instruction_t *ip, vm_node_t *root)  | Function for running the vm, also initializes the vm
| vm_error_t vm_call_node(const vm_instruction_t *ip, vm_node_t *root) | Function for running a function call

| vm_error_t vm_heap_alloc(vm_node_t *node)                            | Allocate a heap object, also cleans the value of the node, subtree will remain
| vm_error_t vm_heap_free(vm_node_t *node)                             | Free a heap object, must be given an reference
| vm_error_t vm_heap_create_reference(vm_node_t *node)                 | Register a new object reference
| vm_error_t vm_heap_remove_reference(vm_node_t *node)                 | Remove a object reference

| vm_error_t vm_heap_verify_open(vm_node_t *node)                      | Check if an open object is valid

### Interrupt
The Interrupt gets called with the specified uint16 as an argument, if the interrupt returns !0 the program jumps to the specified address


### Library
The library is a set of non bytecode functions callable by the program, there are 3 seperate librarys

#### Core Library
The Corelib is provided by the interpreter/loader through vmx_corelib and vmx_corelib_len, the VM expects that the langlib ist static and doesnt change,
the functions get the node as an argument,
the function can return !0 causing the program to crash

#### Language Library
The Langlib is provided by the interpreter/loader through vmx_langlib and vmx_langlib_len,
the same as corelib, but isnt constant at startup, so it can be swapped before the start of the vm,
the library needs to be static during the runtime

#### Dynamic Library
The Dynamic Library is accessed through the vmx_dynlib function, which gets the function id and the node as arguments,
the vmx_dynlib function can return an error.
The vmx_dynlib_test function returns !0 if a dynamic function doesn't exist
